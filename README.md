## Foundation
- *–°leanness* üíé     - Project is built using SOLID principles.
- *Stability* ‚úä     - No memory leaks, thread safe, no crash 
- *Reuse* ü§π‚Äç        - UI is implemented programmatically too. No Storyboard or Xibs.

## Overview
Simple RSS Reader app.

## Expected
- [x] Select multiple RSS feeds & persist.
- [x] If the user already has a selection, don't show the RSS selection screen on app launch.
- [x] Fetch articles from the selected feeds, and persist them.
- [x] Show the articles in reverse chronological order.
- [x] When user clicks an article from the list, show the news article in an in-app browser
- [x] Pull to refresh mechanism

## Bonus
- [x] Add a feature to fade articles once they are read.
- [x] Add a searchbar to the News List Screen. User should be able to filter articles by title.

## Requirements
* iOS 11.0+
* Xcode 10.0+
* Swift 5.0+

## Technical Choices
- *No Storyboards or Xibs* - UI is implemented programatically. I'dont like storyboards beause of some disadventages. Disadventages:  not reusable, merge conflicts are difficult, slow, tricky code reviews etc.
- *All data persisted at documents directory* - There can be many solutions for caching in iOS platforms, like SQLite, CoreData or Realm, or other 3rd libraries. But I deciced to store my data as a JSON data at documentDirectory. I think it is more easier way to handle cache data, there is no need to add SQLite for small projects. To encode / decode my classes I've used Codable protocol.
- *Kingfisher* - I've used Kingfisher pod to download & cache images. https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher
- *MVC Architecture*
